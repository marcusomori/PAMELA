# Description

PAMELA is a dataset of PZT measurements of impedance-based SHM with temperature fluctuations in healthy and damaged conditions. This experiment was conducted at SHM Lab UNESP/Ilha Solteira.

The experimental setup used is presented below.

An aluminum beam with a dimension of  500 mm x 40 mm x 2 mm of length, width, and thickness, respectively, is utilized in the tests. A PZT buzzer from Murata (number 7BB-35-3) with a diameter of 25 mm and thickness of 0.23 mm, with a base plate of brass, is bonded to the surface of the beam, as seen in the setup. The beam is tested in a free-free condition with elastic straps inside a thermal chamber. 

The structural modification to simulate possible damages are a mere mass add by a clip. Four conditions are described represented by damage D1, D2, D3 and D4, as observed in figure bellow.
